							<h3>DNA Project Description</h3>
<h5>Project Philosophy</h5>
<p>DNA Network is a link between blockchain and the real world.</p>
<h5>Project Introduction</h5>
  <p>For a long time, numerous blockchain projects have ended in failure, mainly due to the fact that the linking approach (e.g. QR codes, RFIDs, etc.) between blockchain data and real objects are easy to be forged, and the high difficulty to achieve high accuracy of the original data before uploading it to the blockchain. In order to meet this challenge, Prof. Cheng Xi'en and computer vision experts from Fudan University jointly developed the smart forensic apparatus, through which a microscopic fingerprint image of the physical surface enlarged by N (N≥180) times is captured and uploaded to the IPFS for storage, and then collected by the identity authenticated public chain account and converted into the NFT. When verifying the fingerprints, the identity of the issuer is confirmed first, and then a microscopic image of the real object in the same location with the same magnification is captured and compared with the NFT fingerprint image through artificial intelligence algorithm, so as to link the trillion assets in real world to the blockchain world.</p>						

<h5>Market Size&nbsp;</h5>
<p>DNA Network focuses on NFT tokenization of real-world tangible assets such as luxuries (jewelries, watches, bags, etc.), artwork (antiques, paintings, stamps, ceramics), and souvenirs (Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, Pop Mart, Disney memorabilia, etc.).</p>
<p>The market for tokenized assets is estimated around $16 trillion or 10% of global GDP by 2030, up 50,000% increase from $310 billion in 2022, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group. This includes both tokenized on-chain assets (blockchain-related assets) and traditional assets (e.g., artwork, real estate, luxuries, cars, etc.).</p>

<h5>Problems Solved</h5>
<h6><strong>Issue 1</strong></h6>
<p> The core advantage of the blockchain is its trust mechanism, which allows you to trust the data generated on the chain regardless of the location and time. However, when it comes to accessing information off-chain, it is often relies on specific tools, known as Oracle. These Oracles are usually provided by centralized institutions, which are vulnerable to hacking or manipulation, undermining the accuracy of the raw data on the chain. If the accuracy of the raw data cannot be ensured, the use of blockchain technology will be meaningless, which is also one of the main problems of the failure of some previous blockchain projects.</p>
<h6><strong>Issue 2&nbsp;</strong></h6>
<p> Traditional blockchain data to track real object is mainly realized by means of QR code, barcode, and RFID, which are easy to be forged. This makes it difficult to guarantee the real object linking to the blockchain data not replaced or forged.</p>
<h5>offerings</h5>
<h6>Smart Forensic Appratus</h6>

<h5>DNA Passport</h5>
<h6><strong>present</strong></h6>
<p>DNA Passport is an online-offline identity authorization dApp based on the Ceramic Network that allows users to collect various identity proofs called stamps from Web2 and Web3 authenticators; the stamps are provided by various Web2 and Web3 authenticators including Google, Facebook, Bright ID, ENS and Proof of Humanity. DNA Passport collects the stamps and summarizes them on blockchain based on real-name authentication information provided by offline users, e.g., Li Lei provides his stamp and access through authenticators, and authorization information was collected and access blockchain through his payment account. The user information can be visited through the payment account.</p>
<h6><strong>DNA Passport Enterprise Edition</strong></h6>
<p>The enterprise edition DNA Passport shall be applied through nodes, and typically takes 7 days. Community members will supervise and verify the application during the 7-day publicity period. Upon verification of the submitted information, the enterprise information will be uploaded after the publicity period. The community will penalize the nodes if they submit wrong information maliciously.</p>								
							
<h5>Implementation Principle</h5>
<p>The smart forensic appratus can take images of the surface of physical objects with local magnification N (N≥180) times to generate fingerprint images. And these fingerprint images are uploaded to a centralized server or decentralized storage, and then the information is collected and converted into NFT (non-homogeneous tokens) through a real-name authenticated public chain account. For authentication, the verifier can take a locally enlarged N (N≥180) times image of the same location on the surface of the physical object and compare it with the fingerprint image previously stored on the blockchain through artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>

<h5>application scenario</h5>
<h6>RWA</h6>
<p>RWA, short for Real World Asset tokenization, is the process of converting the value of tangible asset (real estate, high-value commodities, works of art) or intangible asset (ownership, right to income, right to use, etc.) of an interest in (bonds) into digital tokens. This allows assets to be stored and transferred without the need for a central institution, with the value projected to the blockchain for transaction.</p>
<p>The market for tokenized assets is expected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group. DNA Network focuses on NFT tokenization of real-world tangible assets such as luxuries (jewelries, watches, bags, etc.), artwork (antiques, paintings, stamps, ceramics), and memorabilia (Yu-Gi-Oh! decks, Pop Marts, Disney memorabilia, etc.). It solves the problem of RWA's inability to enforce offline clearing through smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Physical NFT</h6>							
<p>Physical assets in the real world, such as artwork, luxury goods, and souvenirs, are transformed into irreplaceable digital tokens (NFTs) through blockchain technology. This enables these physical assets to have uniqueness in the digital realm while retaining their physical presence and value in the real world. The emergence of physical NFTs expands the scope of digital assets, provides value support for digital assets, and offers new ways to collect, trade and prove ownership of real objects.</p>
<h6><strong>metaverse</strong></h6>
<p>Create physical digital assets in the meta-universe that represent physical existence through the authentication of smart forensics apparatus. The scope includes digitized artwork, luxury goods, souvenirs, etc. By projecting digital existence of physical assets in the meta-universe, we can circulate and trade them in the digital world, while maintaining their authenticity and value. This provides users with the opportunity to experience and interact with physical assets in a virtual environment, while creating new digital economic and cultural ecosystems.</p>	
<h6><strong>Smart Customs: Virtual Bonded Warehouse</strong></h6>
<p>Virtual bonded warehouses are simulated bonded warehouses realized through digital technology, smart forensics authentication and blockchain technology, allowing goods to be stored, managed and traded in a virtual environment without the need for actual physical warehousing. The concept is designed to improve global trade efficiency and reduce logistics costs, combined with blockchain to ensure transaction transparency and security. The virtual bonded warehouse creates flexible trade options, simplifies trade processes, facilitates the development of the global digital economy, and is a next-generation standard that China Customs is leading the advancement of.</p>	
<h6><strong>digitisation</strong></h6>
<p>The traditional market is undergoing rejuvenation and digital transformation, with high-net-worth Generation Z participants dominating art investments, showing a preference for personalization and digitalization. Digital transformation encompasses not only the traditional business of investment, collecting, trading and exhibition, but also emerging businesses such as appraisal and evaluation and financial derivatives services based on digital technology. DNA Network continues to drive innovation and the digital revolution, presenting the traditional market with unprecedented opportunities to redefine the high-value product experience, shaping credibility, brand stickiness, and loyalty, while preserving the brand's authenticity and core values.</p>
<h6><strong>&nbsp;Intelligent Logistics</strong></h6>
<p>Based on the DNA Network blockchain service, combined with the smart forensic Internet of Things (IoT) technology, we can build a collaborative alliance consisting of manufacturers, warehouses, logistics providers and customers, the tracks from the production, distribution, and logistics to the customer are credibly recorded, to solve the problem of information isolation, the lack of transparency and other issues. We applied a unique DNA Network technology that combines physical closure and non-falsifiable labels with fingerprint data verification, to provide buyers with enhanced security and to ensure that items are not tampered or damaged.</p>
